# Create-Task-Extracurricular-Finder
The purpose of the program is to allow a BTHS student to find extracurriculars at our school that match their schedule and their interests, as well as let them view information about an extracurricular that they are curious about by searching it.  This was the Create Task I submitted to the 2020 AP Computer Science Principles exam, which I received a 5 on.
